The purpose of the Sundays Art Hub commercial website project is to establish a dynamic online platform that seamlessly integrates art, culture, and community engagement. 
This website aims to showcase the diverse talents fostered within the art hub, offering a virtual gallery space for artists like Elisa Niyogisubizo to exhibit their work. 
Beyond being a visual treat, the website seeks to act as a catalyst for social change, with a particular focus on raising awareness about adoption in Rwanda and dispelling traditional myths. 
By creating an immersive online experience, the purpose is to foster a global community that appreciates and supports art while contributing to meaningful dialogues surrounding societal issues.
Product: Display artwork from various artists in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
